      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm 25 years old, born in Montreal but raised in Rhode Island in the
        United States. I've now been living in Ottawa for 12 years or so. Before
        this program I was in Computer Programming also here at Algonquin
        College, but felt it wasn't the right fit for me as I wanted to be able
        to <em>express</em> myself more in the work I do.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm really into video games, mainly FPS and RPGs. I'm also a big fan of
        movies, Jordan Peele, Denis Villeneuve, and Taika Waititi are my favorite directors. In my
        free time I've recently got into music production, mainly using FL
        Studio. I've been getting a lot of enjoyment out of that. I'm also in a
        metal band, although we've been pretty on and off because we're all in
        school at the moment. I'm looking forward to learning a lot in this
        program and put my best foot forward!
